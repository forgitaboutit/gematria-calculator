## General Info
This gematria calculator currently handles simple English gematria (a=1, b=2, c=3, ...) also known as English ordinal gematria.

My first exposure to gematria came in high school. We were assigned to read the novel The Chosen by Chaim Potok. I was quite fascinated with the novel's depiction of "gematriya" (see chapter 7), but I forgot about it altogether until many years later when a certain individual informed me that the following words in the simple English gematria system all add up the number 74, which is a factor of the biblical number of the beast 666 (which itself is a [triangular number](https://github.com/forgitaboutit/figurate-numbers-generator)): simple, English, gematria, Jewish, Jesus, Joshua, Lucifer, cross, gospel, parables, messiah, occult, Masonic, tarot, and DCLXVI (666 in Roman numerals). Neat, huh? There are many different systems of gematria, but this one is the simplest and easiest to code and calculate. There are much more advanced gematria calculators and databases available on the web (e.g. https://www.gematrix.org).
